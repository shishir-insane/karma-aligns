# Vedic Astrology Prediction Algorithm

## PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION AND CHART PREPARATION

### Step 1.1: Gather Essential Birth Information
1. **Extract precise birth details:**
   - Date, time (hours, minutes, seconds)
   - Birth location (city, state, country)
   - Latitude and longitude coordinates
   - Time zone and daylight saving considerations

2. **Calculate Ayanamsha:**
   - Use Lahiri Ayanamsha (most common) or specified system
   - Subtract ayanamsha value from tropical positions to get sidereal positions

3. **Determine Ascendant (Lagna):**
   - Calculate rising sign at birth time and location
   - Note exact degree of Ascendant
   - This becomes the reference point for house system

### Step 1.2: Generate Primary Charts
1. **Create Rashi Chart (D-1):**
   - Place all 9 planets in their respective signs and houses
   - Calculate exact degrees for each planet
   - Note retrograde status for applicable planets

2. **Generate Essential Divisional Charts:**
   - D-9 (Navamsha): Divide each sign into 9 parts
   - D-10 (Dashamsha): Career analysis chart
   - D-7 (Saptamsha): Children and progeny analysis
   - Additional vargas as needed for specific predictions

### Step 1.3: Calculate Current Planetary Periods
1. **Determine Vimshottari Dasha sequence:**
   - Calculate from Moon's nakshatra position at birth
   - Identify current Mahadasha (major period) and remaining years
   - Calculate current Antardasha (sub-period) and duration
   - Note upcoming Pratyantar dasha (sub-sub period) if needed

2. **Create Dasha timeline:**
   - Mark significant dasha changes in coming years
   - Identify favorable planetary periods based on chart analysis

## PHASE 2: PLANETARY STRENGTH ASSESSMENT

### Step 2.1: Calculate Individual Planetary Strengths
**For each planet, assess:**

1. **Sign-based strength (Rashi Bala):**
   - Own sign (Swakshetra): +5 points
   - Exaltation (Uccha): +4 points
   - Friendly sign: +2 points
   - Neutral sign: 0 points
   - Enemy sign: -2 points
   - Debilitation (Neecha): -4 points

2. **House-based strength (Bhava Bala):**
   - Angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th): +3 points
   - Trikona houses (5th, 9th): +2 points
   - Upachaya houses (3rd, 6th, 11th): +1 point
   - Dusthana houses (6th, 8th, 12th): -2 points

3. **Aspect-based strength:**
   - Benefic aspects received: +1 point each
   - Malefic aspects received: -1 point each
   - Mutual aspects between functional benefics: +2 points

4. **Additional factors:**
   - Retrograde status: +1 point (increased strength)
   - Combust with Sun: -3 points
   - Conjunction with benefics: +1 point
   - Conjunction with malefics: -1 point

### Step 2.2: Calculate Composite Strength Scores
- Sum all factors for each planet
- Create strength ranking from strongest to weakest
- Note planets with negative scores (problematic planets)
- Identify most powerful planets for timing analysis

## PHASE 3: YOGA IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS

### Step 3.1: Detect Major Yogas

**Raj Yogas (Royal Combinations):**
1. Check if lords of Kendra houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) are conjunct with lords of Trikona houses (5th, 9th)
2. Verify if these conjunctions occur in beneficial houses
3. Assess strength of planets forming the yoga
4. Rate yoga strength: Strong/Medium/Weak

**Dhana Yogas (Wealth Combinations):**
1. Examine 2nd house lord placement and strength
2. Check 11th house lord position and condition
3. Look for conjunction between 2nd and 11th lords

**Specific Professional Yogas:**
1. **Gaja Kesari Yoga**: Jupiter and Moon in angular relationship
2. **Budh Aditya Yoga**: Mercury conjunct Sun (intelligence)
