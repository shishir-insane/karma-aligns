# Vedic Astrology Prediction Algorithm

## PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION AND CHART PREPARATION

### Step 1.1: Gather Essential Birth Information

   - Birth location (city, state, country)
   - Latitude and longitude coordinates
   - Time zone and daylight saving considerations

2. **Calculate Ayanamsha:**
   - Use Lahiri Ayanamsha (most common) or specified system
   - Subtract ayanamsha value from tropical positions to get sidereal positions

3. **Determine Ascendant (Lagna):**
   - Calculate rising sign at birth time and location
   - Note exact degree of Ascendant
   - This becomes the reference point for house system

### Step 1.2: Generate Primary Charts
1. **Create Rashi Chart (D-1):**
   - Place all 9 planets in their respective signs and houses
   - Calculate exact degrees for each planet
   - Note retrograde status for applicable planets

2. **Generate Essential Divisional Charts:**
   - D-9 (Navamsha): Divide each sign into 9 parts
   - D-10 (Dashamsha): Career analysis chart
   - D-7 (Saptamsha): Children and progeny analysis
   - Additional vargas as needed for specific predictions

### Step 1.3: Calculate Current Planetary Periods
1. **Determine Vimshottari Dasha sequence:**
   - Calculate from Moon's nakshatra position at birth
   - Identify current Mahadasha (major period) and remaining years
